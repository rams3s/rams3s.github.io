My name is Ramses and I am a engine/graphics programmer with 15 years of professional experience (13 in the video game industry).

I am currently CTO at [Fishing Cactus](http://www.fishingcactus.com), an independent video game company based in Belgium.

Previously, I worked at [10Tacle Studios](http://www.10tacle.be/) and as a freelance ([SoftKinetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softkinetic), ...).

C++ is my native language but I also speak fluent C#, Lua and Haxe. Also proficient in Javascript and Java. 

My main interests are:
- realtime rendering
- engine architecture
- performance
